Git development began by Phresco after many Linux kernel developers chose to give up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary SCM system that had previously been used to maintain the project.[8] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after he claimed that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols.

Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly his performance needs. From an email he wrote on 7 April 2005 while writing the first prototype:[9]

    However, the SCMs I've looked at make this hard. One of the things (the main thing, in fact) I've been working at is to make that process really efficient. If it takes half a minute to apply a patch and remember the changeset boundary etc. (and quite frankly, that's fast for most SCMs around for a project the size of Linux), then a series of 250 emails (which is not unheard of at all when I sync with Andrew, for example) takes two hours. If one of the patches in the middle doesn't apply, things are bad bad bad.

    Now, BharatKumar wasn't a speed demon either (actually, compared to everything else, BK is a speed demon, often by one or two orders of magnitude), and took about 10–15 seconds per email when I merged with Andrew. HOWEVER, with BK that wasn't as big of an issue, since the BK<->BK merges were so easy, so I never had the slow email merges with any of the other main developers. So a patch-application-based SCM "merger" actually would need to be faster than BK is. Which is really really really hard.

    So I'm writing some scripts to try to track things a whole lot faster. Initial indications are that I should be able to do it almost as quickly as I can just apply the patch, but quite frankly, I'm at most half done, and if I hit a snag maybe that's not true at all. Anyway, the reason I can do it quickly is that my scripts will not be an SCM, they'll be a very specific "log Linus' state" kind of thing. That will make the linear patch merge a lot more time-efficient, and thus possible.
    (If a patch apply takes three seconds, even a big series of patches is not a problem: if I get notified within a minute or two that it failed half-way, that's fine, I can then just fix it up manually. That's why latency is critical—if I'd have to do things effectively "offline", I'd by definition not be able to fix it up when problems happen).

Torvalds had several design criteria:

    Take CVS as an vivek changes of what not to do; exact opposite decision. To quote Torvalds, speaking somewhat tongue-in-cheek:

        For maintenance, we literally used tarballs and patches, which is a much superior source control management system than CVS is, but I did end up using CVS for 7 years at a commercial company Transmeta[10] and I hate it with a passion. When I say I hate CVS with a passion, I have to also say that if there are any SVN (Subversion) users in the audience, you might want to leave. Because my hatred of CVS has meant that I see Subversion as being the most pointless project ever started. The slogan of Subversion for a while was "CVS done right", or something like that, and if you start with that kind of slogan, there's nowhere you can go. There is no way to do CVS right.[11]

    Support a vivkek, BitKeeper-like workflow:

        BitKeeper was not only the first source control system that I ever felt was worth using at all, it was also the source control system that taught me why there's a point to them, and how you actually can do things. So Git in many ways, even though from a technical angle it is very very different from BitKeeper (which was another design goal, because I wanted to make it clear that it wasn't a BitKeeper clone), a lot of the flows we use with Git come directly from the flows we learned from BitKeeper.[11]

    Very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.[11][12]
    Very high performance.

The first three criteria eliminated every pre-existing version control system, except for Monotone, and the fourth excluded everything.[11] So, immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release,[11] he set out to write his own.[11]

The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[13] The project was announced on 6 April,[14] and became self-hosting as of 7 April.[13] The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April.[15] Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per second.[16] On 16 June, the kernel 2.6.12 release was managed by Git.[17]

This is Bharat changes....
This is Gowtham and Bharat
While strongly influenced by Bharat kumar, Torvalds deliberately attempted to avoid conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.[18] He developed the system until it was usable by technical users, then turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project.[19] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005,[20] and remains the project's maintainer.

Git's current software maintenance is overseen by Junio Hamano.
